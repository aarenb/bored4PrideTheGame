### Comment

Found bug in test case 6.2.1: "Oof" sound effect only plays sometimes when player takes damage, no found pattern for when it happens.

Found bug in test case 9.4: Sometimes the follow bot doesn't drop anything when killed, doesn't happen very often but no found pattern for when it happens.

Found bug in test case 10: The game freezes for a split second when the sussy bit is picked up, before the rick roll music starts playing
