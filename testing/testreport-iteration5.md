# Testreport iteration 5

## User testing

**Notes from test user:**
- Hard to talk to Wongy NPC, having to walk towards + press enter key every time for a new dialogue window
- Pressing space bar would feel better than pressing enter key for attacking
- Way too easy to die from the follow bots, make invinsible countdown longer for player

### Comment

Bug found last iteration in TC3.2 has been fixed. TC3.1 dialogue window looks different than it used to since full screen has been added, need to make it less wide. Add test cases for options menu next week and try to do more user testing
